  1.Hand gesture recognition has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its wide applications in robotics, games, virtual reality, sign language and human-computer interaction. 

  2.Sign language is a structured form of hand gestures and the most effective communication way among hear-impaired people.

  3.Developing an efficient sign language recognition system to recognize dynamic isolated gestures encounters three major challenges, namely, hand segmentation, hand shape feature representation and gesture sequence recognition.
